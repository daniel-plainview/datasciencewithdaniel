My first encounter with Python was in the subject called Computational Thinking with Python. It was difficult to learn Python from a non-programming background and the projects we were required to do in the subject were challenging for me as a beginning. However, it surely was rewarding when I finished the project and got the output required. 

The project was to use stylometry to verify authorship, where it required us to use dictionaries to create profiles for two input files, that could be articles, research papers and books. The profiles need to include the number of occurrences of each word, punctuations, conjunction words, and the average number of words in a sentence as well as the number of sentences in a paragraph. The profiles are used to make comparisons between the two input files, and we can decide whether they are produced by the same person. Once the profiles are created, another function should be created to compute the distance between the corresponding profiles. 

My approach for this project was first to write the pseudocode, which helps me to plan out my approaches and think about all the functions I should define to create the profiles. Then I created functions for the words and punctuations that need to be counted. I faced a number of difficulties, such as when defining the punctuation function to not count the single quote in words like “can’t” and “don’t”, and how to count for decimal numbers. In order to solve these issues, I think it is mostly helpful to write in small chunks of code and debugging, rather than write a whole function and try to figure out where it had gone wrong. In addition, Stack Overflow is one of the most helpful resources to answer questions I have had. 

For anyone who is a beginner in Python, don’t be scared of it and it will take a lot of trial and errors in the beginning to get the output you want, but it will be a good learning experience and with plenty of practice, you will become an expert in Python soon.
