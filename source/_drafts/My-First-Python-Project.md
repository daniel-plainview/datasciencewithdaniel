My first encounter with Python was in the subject called Computational Thinking with Python. It was difficult to learn Python from a non-programming background and the projects we were required to do were challenging for me as a beginner. However, it was rewarding when I finished the project and got the output required. 

The project was to use stylometry to verify authorship, where it required us to use dictionaries to create profiles for two input files, that could be articles, research papers or books. The profiles need to include the number of occurrences of each word, punctuations, conjunction words, and the average number of words in a sentence as well as the number of sentences in a paragraph. The profiles were used to make comparisons between the two input files, and we could see whether they were produced by the same person. Once the profiles have been created, another function was used to compute the distance between the corresponding profiles. 

My approach for this project was first to write the pseudocode, or code in English that described what should happen, which helps to plan out my approach and think about all the functions I should define to create the profiles. Then I created functions for the words and punctuations that need to be counted. I faced a number of difficulties, such as when defining the punctuation function, to not count the single apostrophe in words like “can’t” and “don’t”, and how to account for decimal numbers. In order to solve these issues, I think it is mostly helpful to write in small chunks of code, rather than write a whole function and try to figure out where it had gone wrong. In addition, Stack Overflow is one of the most helpful resources to answer questions that I had. 

For anyone who is a beginner in Python, don’t be scared, it will take a lot of trial and errors in the beginning to get the output you want, but it will be a good learning experience, and with plenty of practice, you will become an expert in Python soon.
