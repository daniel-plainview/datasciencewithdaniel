Is statistics important in data science? Many people may believe it is not as important as other aspects of data science, such as data engineering, machine learning and etc. Letâ€™s begin with what statistics really is. Statistics is a process of collecting, organising and analysing data with samples that can represent a whole population, using mathematical methods. Statistics can be as simple as calculating the average of observations in a data set. However, it can also be as complicated as using various statistical models to analyse and understand the data, for example, using regression to identify any relationships among variables. 

Statistics plays an integral part in data science to help us analyse the data we have. In fact, many open-source libraries and packages in Python and R have already incorporated statistics, such as scikit-learn and Pandas in Python. These packages make the data training process more efficient and does not necessarily require us to have a thorough understanding of the stats behind them. However, in order to improve your model performance, it is important to understand every aspect of the algorithm including the stats and better interpret the results. 

It is not required for a data scientist to be a statistician, however, it is important for data scientist to have a good understanding of stats and use it to improve their model performance and efficiency.
