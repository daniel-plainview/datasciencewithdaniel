[The Age of A.I.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwsrzCVZAb8) is a documentary hosted by Robert Downey Jr., showcases the development of Artificial Intelligence and how innovators are pushing the boundaries. It is an informative documentary presented in a fun and engaging way by the 'iron man', enabling audiences learn about where A.I. can change human's life. 

The documentary covers 8 different topics, including building an artificial human, healing and replacing human body, creating a life in Mars and so on. Artificial Intelligence has been a hot topic in recent years and is spaking a range of new potentials for humans, but what exactly can A.I. do and what more can it offer? There are several stories in each episode of the documentary, depicts how A.I. is being useful in many different fields and how all our lives could benefit from it. 

The first episode, ["How Far is Too Far?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwsrzCVZAb8), introduced the lifelike simulation of a toddler, named Baby X. The purpose of the simulation is to see whether a machine could be trained to have emotions and become human-like. Baby X is given a virtual brain, trained by  neural networks to similute human's brain and learn like how a human does. The learning process for Baby X is through object recognition, for example, when Baby X is shown a 'spider', the image is formed in the virtual brain and the 'baby' starts to remember the word and the image of a spider. Then the 'baby' is taught that 'spider' is scary and 'baby' learns it and starts to cry, just like how a real baby cries when they are scared. This is a life changing simulation and also shows how A.I. could interfere with our lives. 

It is truely amazing with how much artificial intellignece can do and working together with A.I. could really help our lives in many ways. If you want to check out what more Artificial Intelligence does, be sure to check out the [documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwsrzCVZAb8).
