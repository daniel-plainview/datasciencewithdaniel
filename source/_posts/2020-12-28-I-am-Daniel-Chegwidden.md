I am about to enter my final year of a Master of Data Science at the University of Western Australia. My data science journey started 2 years prior when I commenced this course after starting to work at the university. I originally completed a degree in Accounting and Finance before working in both banking and auditing, but I have found my passion with data science.

I was fortunate enough to be able to both work and study for the first 2 years of the course, where I learnt technical skills such as Python and R in class, and then put them into action as a Data Analyst. This experience added a practical layer to what was in the textbook and allowed me to go deeper and learn more for languages such as SQL. I have enjoyed my studies so far, with units such as Cloud Computing where we learnt AWS, and Machine Learning, giving me the skills that every Data Scientist needs.

Returning to full-time study for my final year will allow me to give my studies the attention they deserve and finish off the course strongly as I become a Data Scientist. I am still trying to figure out what kind of Data Scientist I want to be when I graduate, as each semester brings new and interesting units that make me change my mind of where I want my journey to continue. The professors that I have learnt from and the fellow students I have studied with have made my journey into data science an amazing experience, and I cannot wait to see what comes next for me.
