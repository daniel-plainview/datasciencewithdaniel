Welcome to *Data Science with Daniel!*

We seek to build a community of Data Scientists, so that we can share our passion and learn together. We do this by bringing everything and everyone together in one place; *Data Science with Daniel*.

For Students; We support anyone on their Data Science journey by providing an environment where they can ask questions, find answers and connect with others.

For Industry; We engage with industry to understand the Data Science landscape and ensure that the next generation of Data Scientists develop the skills to succeed in their career.

For Academics; We promote studying Data Science to bring new people into the field and provide feedback to improve these studies. 

If you want to be part of our community, click on the **Community** tab to join the Slack and connect with fellow Data Scientists. If you have something to say, you can write and contribute posts through our [GitHub](https://github.com/datasciencewithdaniel/datasciencewithdaniel), or if you are happy reading the stories on this site, then that is alright too. We hope that you learn something that helps you succeed in your future.

I look forward to seeing you online.
