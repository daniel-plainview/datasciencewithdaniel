Working as a consultant at a an Agri-Tech consultancy has taught me a few things about data and drawing inferences from data. The most profound of them is the ability to tell the most useful piece of information from the least useful piece of information. It might so happen that the most significant piece of information is actually metadata and not the data itself.

Information about the dataset is called metadata and is often overlooked by amature data scientists (like myself). It so happened once when I was classifying crops across a whole region and somewhere in the process forgot the date at which these satellite images were captured. The date is critical for the client, and there is a penality for every mistake. Being a naive graduate, ended up doing the whole thing again. The next morning, when I narrated the whole thing to a colleague, he told me about metadata and that was the greatest facepalm I ever had.

So everyone whow wants to play around with data, please take a few minutes to glance over the metadata. It might help you answer some rudimentary questions like "What is this ?" , "When is this ? " , "What is not in this ?", which are often mission critical.
